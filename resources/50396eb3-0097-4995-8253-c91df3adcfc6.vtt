00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Realistically,
the major issues are

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.000
with PDF documents.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.800
Title: Problematic PDFs

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.280
Bane of my life

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.840
but loved by organisations.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.960
With PDF... Honestly, why we keep using PDF,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.480
I don't know.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.840
We've got epub three, we've got HTML.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.240
There are massive issues around PDF

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.000
where... I also use
an electronic braille display.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.120
And so

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.880
the PDFs need to be converted

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.600
to plain text
so I can access it with the braille.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.760
But then you lose all the formatting

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.040
Yes. PDF. Certain formats of pdf.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.200
So for example, when you're online,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.960
you’re doing your training,
you're asked to refer to a document.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.040
I would attempt to download that document

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.040
so that I can convert it,
so I can read it.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.040
Normally what I would do save it.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.160
Use the high contrast filter on it.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
Unfortunately, some PDFs
when they're saved,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.680
you lose all the formatting
so you're unable to see the headings.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.520
You're unable to make much sense of it,
especially if you're completing a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.840
you're completing a test
within the timeframe

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
which some of our training
requires us to do.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.800
Untagged PDF documents,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.520
they are like,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.680
I have to convert them into Word,
so I can make them accessible

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.840
and keep my accessibility checker on so

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.480
I can work on those documents.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.960
so I can tell you
about how PDFs interrupt my workflow,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.560
and I think workflow is a really good way
of thinking about it because you think,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.640
right, 9:00 at work got my coffee, open,
my emails, start to use them,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.760
and you're like: ‘Great,
I'm going to use this, I'm going to open this,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.320
I'm going to action it’ and then
you  go: ‘bom, bom, bom, bom’.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.280
Can't go any further
because the document is not accessible.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.520
So what you had planned that half an hour
chunked out to do that work.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
You can't do that work.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.000
And then often when you've got a document
that's not accessible,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.400
the first thing that the person on

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.440
the other side says is,: ‘Well,
what's wrong with it?’

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.440
And I can't just say, it doesn't read out
or JAWS doesn't work with it.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.400
I need to really... they want me to give them
some detailed instruction

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.240
on how to fix it.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.560
So you become responsible
for identifying the problem.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.680
Then you become responsible for trying
to train the person in fixing the problem.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Yet that is not
what you're employed to do at work.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.120
But if you don't do that education piece
and get them engaged, you're not likely

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.280
to get the document back.
