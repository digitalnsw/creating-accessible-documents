00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.400
The thing
I suppose around accessible documents

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.600
is that I do get very tired
of people saying

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.880
we need to make this accessible for Jodie,
rather than saying

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.040
we actually just need to make sure
this is accessible for everybody.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.560
Title: Digital barriers in documents

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.160
so the challenges for me

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.320
are very much that I
then don't have access

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.560
to the same information
as everybody else at the same time.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.200
So that can impact my ability

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.920
to respond to a document,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.600
to collaborate and also to be able

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.360
to be informed when I'm making decisions

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.160
or a part of decision
making in the work place.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.520
It's just really frustrating
because you can't access the material

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.240
when you sit down

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.400
and you want to access it.
So it's always on pause

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.280
and hold your always running on
somebody else's time frame.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000
It might mean for a work task
that I can't complete the work task

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.520
either
in the timeframe that my manager wants it.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.800
And it's difficult
because people have this idea

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.680
that they'll get to it when they get to it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560
without realizing
that I'm running to a deadline.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.800
So you don't have autonomy or self control
over the work that you're doing.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.800
So it's frustrating.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.080
Look, I think one of the biggest problems

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
that I confront is

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.160
achieving the same level of independence
as other people.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.040
So the right to read something
and understand it independently.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.560
Now, sometimes

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.120
it's formatted in a way that you can't.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120
You need somebody else to do it for you.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.280
So it is a survey
they now know how you answered,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.320
but everybody else normally would have
the right to do it confidentially.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.600
And that is a real challenge

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.920
because you do feel
and that's the word I like to use,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.160
diminished by the fact
that somebody else knows something.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.440
They know your answer

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.800
when it's assumed that
that's a confidential answer.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.440
Having to rely on someone else
to make the document or anything

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.520
accessible for me,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.800
it does... It's...

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.120
It can be quite embarrassing

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.640
You know, sometimes I feel like

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.520
I'm not doing something right.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.240
And it feels like
I'm obviously frustrated sometimes.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.640
And and you're basically relying

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.920
on someone to do those,
you know, filling out

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.280
and writing down your details for you.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.960
So, yeah,
it's it's frustrating, basically.
