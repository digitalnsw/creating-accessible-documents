00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.840
The impact of

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.480
having accessible information

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.000
really excites me.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.920
I get so excited when I receive

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.080
something that I need to read
and it's just easy.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.920
Title: When documents are accessible

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.080
I can read it,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.600
I can, you know, often
I can whip through the information faster

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.720
than a sighted person because my screen
reader goes a million miles an hour.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
And it's... it really is exhilarating.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.720
I get very excited
when a new feature is rolled out

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.280
on, you know, in a tool
that we need to use in the workplace.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.760
And it just works for me.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.040
This is remarkable.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.480
I can read for an hour now.
And they said, ‘What?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.200
Couldn't you read for an hour before?’
I said, ‘No, I couldn't’.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.960
I used to have to take breaks all the time
and I never knew

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.960
whether a migraine
was going to visit me the next day.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.400
Now I can read for as long as I like

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
because it was made accessible

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.840
it's like when you cook a cake,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.680
you know, when you cook a cake
and you've got everything ready

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.760
and it comes out of the oven, it's
perfectly brown all over,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.000
not a bit brown here and a bit
white there.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.040
Or when you run for the train
and you put your foot on the platform

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.200
and the train comes in and
then you get a seat and then you arrive.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.920
Then there's a coffee place right there,
it all works.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.520
So it feels like a real winner.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.400
It's really rewarding.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.640
And again, it keeps you going.
