00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
It almost cements this idea in my head
that I'm an idiot.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.800
If everyone else can read this,
why can't I?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.520
Title: Plain language with good structure is important

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.240
And an example of that is
I asked a colleague

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.760
for this same scenario with procurement

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.760
to help me kind of read it through

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.680
and say like:

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.680
‘Am I? Am I so dumb that I'm not getting this?’

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.240
Like, are you taking the information
from this that I'm missing?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.280
And he then started the process.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.520
We collectively have started the process
to create our own document,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200
to make it easy

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.600
so that if you don't have experience
with this,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.320
you have somewhere to go that's

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.280
easy to read and accessible regardless

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
of your knowledge level.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.880
Well, based on people's reading levels
and diverse backgrounds

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
I just think having documents
that are plain English, accessible,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.800
will ensure that the message
that you're communicating has been sent

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.240
and received and understood

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.000
so that people can act in the way
that you would like them to act.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.160
I think that if they had...

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.120
and it makes it much more enjoyable,
you've got that stakeholder,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.720
you've got that engagement with people
because it's easy to access the material.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.920
It's easy then to want to get involved.
So particularly

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.120
a work thing, I'll get sent a report
or a PowerPoint presentation.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.880
You're sending it to me because
you probably want something from me.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.240
So if the document is accessible,
then straight away I open it or action it.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.600
So you're not waiting on me,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.680
and then I can give you what it is
that you want from me.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.840
But if you haven't given me what I need,
then I can't help you with your part.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.560
So it's like, help me help you.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.160
Help me, help you, you know,
and that makes it easy for everybody.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080
And it's better than retrofitting

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.560
I've got great comprehension.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.000
I’m a really good reader.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.840
But when it's using big words
for the sake of using big words

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.240
or it's not clear in the message
that kind of fluffs

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.040
about and it’s all in shades of grey and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.960
it just makes it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.480
particularly difficult
to know what you can and can't do.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.200
And there's always that kind of fear that

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.880
in the back of your mind,
if you're not following that, that could

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.720
potentially be that, you know,
that could have consequences for you.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.280
So there's always that kind of weird fear
that if you're not retaining information

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.280
that you need to be
on the right side of the rules.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.640
That is, it's quite stressful.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.400
And again, back to just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.720
makes you feel really dumb.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.960
I think there's a couple of things.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.480
It's JAWS will read things out
exactly as they are.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.640
So when people are using acronyms
or they're shortening words,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.000
it'll read it out that way.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.640
It won't say, it'll spell it out
or thinks it's a word.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.120
So do I.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.440
Sounds a bit exotic, so better not to use
acronyms or shortening things.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.960
Use the whole word.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.440
So government loves technical
jargon or acronyms.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.800
Apparently we are too busy to say
talent acquisition.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.800
We have to say TA
or we're too busy to say,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.680
you know, we've got all these little terms
that we use

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.840
and we're far too busy
to actually use those two words.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.520
We've always got to shorten everything.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.920
And particularly if you knew when you
started a new job with a new organisation,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.000
they’re like QNZ that FXZ that,
you know, like it's a little different

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.080
you’re like ‘What? What? What? I

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920
need a decoder ring

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.600
and I don't have a memory issue
and I don't have a brain

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.000
processing issue and I read and write
English and I grew up in Australia.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.240
So if I'm struggling,
how is anybody else going to cope?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.000
And we're a really diverse workforce.
