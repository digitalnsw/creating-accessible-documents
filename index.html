If everyone else can read this, why can't I?</p>\n<p>And an example of that is I asked a colleague for this same scenario with procurement to help me kind of read it through and say like, Am I? Am I so dumb that I'm not getting this? Like, are you taking the information from this that I'm missing? And he then started the process. We collectively have started the process to create our own document, to make it easy so that if you don't have experience with this, you have somewhere to go that's easy to read and accessible regardless of your knowledge level.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Stephanie</strong></p>\n<p>Well, based on people's reading levels and diverse backgrounds, I just think having documents that are plain English, accessible, will ensure that the message that you're communicating has been sent and received and understood so that people can act in the way that you would like them to act. I think that if they had... and it makes it much more enjoyable, you've got that stakeholder, you've got that engagement with people because it's easy to access the material.</p>\n<p>It's easy then to want to get involved. So particularly a work thing, I'll get sent a report or a PowerPoint presentation. You're sending it to me because you probably want something from me. So if the document is accessible, then straight away I open it or action it. So you're not waiting on me, and then I can give you what it is that you want from me</p>\n<p>But if you haven't given me what I need, then I can't help you with your part. So it's like, help me help you. Help me, help you, you know, and that makes it easy for everybody. And it's better than retrofitting</p>\n<p><strong>Liza</strong></p>\n<p>I've got great comprehension. I’m a really good reader. But when it's using big words for the sake of using big words or it's not clear in the message that kind of fluffs about and it’s all in shades of grey and it just makes it particularly difficult to know what you can and can't do. And there's always that kind of fear that in the back of your mind, if you're not following that, that could potentially be that, you know, that could have consequences for you.</p>\n<p>So there's always that kind of weird fear that if you're not retaining information that you need to be on the right side of the rules. That is, it's quite stressful. And again, back to just makes you feel really dumb.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Stephanie</strong></p>\n<p>I think there's a couple of things. It's JAWS will read things out exactly as they are. So when people are using acronyms or they're shortening words, it'll read it out that way. It won't say... it'll spell it out or thinks it's a word. So it sounds a bit exotic, so better not to use acronyms or shortening things. Use the whole word.</p>\n<p>So government loves technical jargon or acronyms. Apparently we are too busy to say talent acquisition. We have to say TA or we're too busy to say, you know, we've got all these little terms that we use and we're far too busy to actually use those two words.</p>\n<p>We've always got to shorten everything. And particularly if you knew when you started a new job with a new organisation, they’re like QNZ that FXZ that, you know, like it's a little different you’re like ‘What? What? What? I need a decoder ring and I don't have a memory issue and I don't have a brain processing issue and I read and write English and I grew up in Australia.</p>\n<p>So if I'm struggling, how is anybody else going to cope?

So for example, when you're online, you’re doing your training, you're asked to refer to a document. I would attempt to download that document so that I can convert it, so I can read it. Normally what I would do save it. Use the high contrast filter on it. Unfortunately, some PDFs when they're saved, you lose all the formatting, so you're unable to see the headings.

I'm going to action it’ and then you go: ’Bom, bom... Bom, bom. Can't go any further because the document is not accessible. So what you had planned that half an hour chunked out to do that work. You can't do that work. And then often when you've got a document that's not accessible, the first thing that the person on the other side says is, well, what's wrong with it? And I can't just say, it doesn't read out or JAWS doesn't work with it. I need to really they want me to give them some detailed instruction on how to fix it. So you become responsible for identifying the problem. Then you become responsible for trying to train the person in fixing the problem. Yet that is not what you're employed to do at work.
